# projects
This repository contains a few projects that I made.
One of them contains a project based on Natural Language Processing (NLP), in which I trained a model and predicted the life expectancy according to the values in the dataset.
Another one contains a project based on Computer Vision (CV), in which I made a ping-pong game, which recognizes our hands as bats and has a score checker which counts the score according to the game.
